# ENPM661project1 8-Puzzle Solver

To run my 8-puzzle solver simply run the "8puzzle.py" file from the terminal by "python3 8puzzle.py" . If you would like to change the initial state, the startNode varible is at the bottom of the file before calling the main function. 

The only library used was the numpy library which was used in the professor's code to visualize the solution.

All comments are in text cells preceding the described code.(then exported from jupyter notebook to py file)

All code was completed before the 2/13 class where I asked about the purpose of frequent commits. The only new code since then is the solvability function which is documented and based off the links on canvas. EDIT: new comparison of ints in the addnode function was added after class feb20.

To run my 8-puzzle solver simply run the "8-puzzle.ipynb" file cell by cell (shift+enter). If you would like to change the initial state, the startNode varible is in my solver cell directly below the checkSolvability function. 

The only library used was the numpy library which was used in the professor's code to visualize the solution.

All comments are in text cells preceding the described code.

All code was completed before the 2/13 class where I asked about the purpose of frequent commits. The only new code since then is the solvability function which is documented and based off the links on canvas.
